# Dear Spotify, this is what I can do

Some of the projects I developed during my time at the University of Warsaw. The purpose of this repo is to showcase my experience in Java and Android dev.

# Java projects

There are three projects:
- Concurrent Programming Project focused on implementing mechanism of transactions (similiar to the ones common in SQL): `java/cp1`
- Object-Oriented Programming Project focused on implementing various algorithms solving problem of cover of a set: `java/cover`
- Object-Oriented Programming Project that simulates process of elections (in polish): `java/wybory`

# Android project

BookBook is the biggest project I have participated yet. Our goal was to create an app that connects people who love books and want to share their favorite books. Android-part of the app can be found in `android/BookBook/app`.
